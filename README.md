## Usage

## What I learned

This project really reinforced how to use flexboxes that create a responsive layout to different device sizes.

Some fun things I played with were:

    Adding a Favicon to my browser tab.
  
    Making pictures clickable out to a URL and scalable upon hover.
  
    Setting a custom background image for the entire site.
