# Eric Kellogg's Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

In this project I created an employee payroll web application.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Enter in employee(s) First Name, Last Name, and Salary and it'll display on the table.  Within the console it'll tell you the average Salary and who the random drawing winner is.
